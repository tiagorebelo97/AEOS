## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives Met

âœ… **Primary Objective**: "Make the AEOS program a container to run on Podman"
- AEOS is now fully containerized
- Works with both Docker and Podman
- One-command deployment available
- Fully documented

âœ… **Secondary Objectives**:
- Analyzed and summarized the AEOS system from PDF
- Confirmed it was not containerized originally
- Created production-ready container setup
- Provided multiple deployment methods
- Extensive documentation for users

## ðŸš€ Deployment Ready

The AEOS system is now ready to deploy:

```bash
# Quick deployment with Podman
./deploy-podman.sh

# Or with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Or with Makefile
make up-podman
```

All objectives completed! âœ¨
